PySideX
=======

I am trying to transition from using PySide to PySide2.  This simple wrapping package is intended to help with this
process.  I am looking to write new code with this wrapper so that when the systems I am currently using all have
PySide2 installed on them I can simply replace the PySideX text with PySide2.
